# qedit

qedit is a simple and easy to maintain editor, designed to run portably on as many
operating systems and architectures as possible. It does so by leveraging the cross-compile
features of Go, and the very portable [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell)
terminal library. A side effect of using Go is the absolute simplicity with which
the project can be maintained. For an open source project under the very permissive
MIT license, this is important.

## Goals

 * An editor designed in the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle.
 * DOS-like user interface library for Go/tcell (pkg/ui)
 * Modern [rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)) buffer (used in emacs)
 * Modern text editing, including: copy/paste, mouse support, selection, etc.
 * Btree-based tiling and floating window management (panels)
 * Extensions via IPC or some scripting language
 * Built-in terminal

## Development

### Building

You will need:

 * A clone or download of this repository
 * A Go compiler version supporting Go 1.16+
 * A temporary internet connection

With Go successfully in your path variable, open a terminal and navigate to the
directory containing go.mod, and execute the following command:

```
go build -o qedit ./cmd/qedit.go
```

But I prefer to use `go run ./cmd/qedit.go` while developing.

#### Profiling

Insert the `-cpuprofile` or `-memprofile` flags before the list of files when running qedit, like so:

```sh
go run ./cmd/qedit.go -cpuprofile cpu.prof [files]
# or
qedit -cpuprofile cpu.prof [files]
```

### Layout

This project follows the [project layout standard for Go projects](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout). At first glance it nearly makes no sense without the context, but here's the rundown for our project:

 - **cmd/** ‒ Program entries.
 - **internal/** ‒ Private code only meant to be used by qedit.
 - **pkg/** ‒ Public code in packages we share with anyone who wants to use them.
   + **pkg/buffer/** ‒ Buffers for text editors and contains an optional syntax highlighting system.
   + **pkg/ui/** ‒ The custom DOS-like user interface library used in qedit.

## Contributing

I love contributions!

Currently, I am focused on working solo, so there aren't many issues authored and I'm
doing most work quietly. If I know there are people interested in contributing, I will
change how I am working on qedit.

As for types of contributions: I am currently seeking bug fixes, and resolving all of
my `TODO` comments in the code. Or possibly removing them and turning them into issues.
Possibly the best contribution I could receive is someone using my editor as a daily-driver
(bless them for their troubles) and reporting issues or improvements.

If you would like to communicate, you can message me on Matrix: `@fivemoreminix:matrix.org`,
or Discord: `fivemoreminix#7637`, or even email: thelukaswils ATT (the google one)

## For Answers and Questions (FAQ)

### Why another text editor?
I like using my own software. I also like retro aesthetic, so I designed my own
modern text editor around the simple and stylish MS-DOS EDIT.COM editor. I am
pleased to use it for all of my text editing purposes, and it is what 80% of qedit
has been edited with.

I made qedit simple and easy to maintain, and MIT licensed, so anyone like
you can make a fork and have your own personal editor.

### Why Go?
Truthfully, I spent about a year delaying work on the editor, because I didn't want
to use Go, Python, or any other language. I wanted to use Zig, because it was portable,
fast, and efficient. I spent months working on [termelot](https://github.com/minierolls/termelot),
a terminal library similar to tcell, but for Zig. When Zig is ready, I will continue
work on the library, but this editor is likely to forever remain in Go.

I finally came around when I decided that the tcell library is excellent, and would
make programming my editor easy. I started working, and I haven't regretted choosing Go,
and the performance of the editor is fantastic.
